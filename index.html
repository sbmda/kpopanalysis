                    <p style="margin-top: 80px;">I have only just gotten into Stray Kids.</p>
                    <p>I‚Äôve been listening to their music, on and off, ever since the group came out with <em>God‚Äôs Menu</em> back in 2020, but it took me until this fall to dive fully into their discography. The turning point was <em>Chk Chk Boom</em>; it was catchy, it fit right within my taste, and before I knew it I found myself replaying it multiple times a day.</p>
                    <p>However, it didn‚Äôt take me more than a few listens to realize that, as catchy as the song was‚Ä¶ it was incredibly short. At 2 minutes and 28 seconds, despite being the title track, it is the shortest track on <em>ATE</em>, the album it appears on. The second place goes to <em>I Like It</em>, another song heavily promoted after its release‚Äîit‚Äôs only a second shorter than <em>Chk Chk Boom</em>. On Stray Kids‚Äô latest release, <em>HOP</em>, only two tracks go beyond the three-minute mark.</p>
                    <div class="parent scroll">
                        <img class="image1" src="assets/img/skz.png" />
                        <img class="image2" src="assets/img/frame.gif" />
                    </div>  
                    <p>The question kept gnawing at me‚Äî<em>where are the long songs?</em> Think of the four-minute grandiose tracks that were common currency among second generation groups, like Girls‚Äô Generation‚Äôs <em>I Got a Boy</em>, at 4 minutes and 31 seconds, or TVXQ‚Äôs <em>Catch Me</em>, that was even longer at 4 minutes and 39 seconds. Even among third generation groups, songs below the three-minute mark were incredibly rare, to my memory.</p>
                    <p>Nowadays (and it isn‚Äôt just an issue with Stray Kids), it seems as though three minutes isn‚Äôt even considered a standard in song length anymore. How has it changed over time? In order to answer this question, I‚Äôve set out to analyze over 9000 K-Pop songs released between 2007 and 2024 and their duration, using <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/" target="_blank">MusicBrainz</a>‚Äôs database, an online collaborative music database (see <a href="#methodology">methodology</a> for details).</p>

On the other end of the spectrum, <strong>TVXQ</strong> has the longest songs, at about <strong>3 minutes and 52 seconds</strong> on average.

                        <p>How do these trends manifest within a single entertainment company? Let‚Äôs take a look at one of the so-called ‚ÄúBig Four‚Äù entertainment companies in South Korea. SM Entertainment, JYP Entertainment and YG Entertainment long dominated the industry as the ‚ÄúBig Three‚Äù, before HYBE (previously BigHit Entertainment) took over the market, riding on BTS‚Äôs gigantic worldwide success. Their important number of artists and songs, as well as their overall market success, makes the same kind of analysis possible within the same agency.</p>
                        <p>To continue, pick an agency among the Big Four. </p>

This year, songs by <strong><span class="agency-name"></span></strong> artists were about <strong><span id="mnts_2024"></span> minutes and <span id="scds_2024"></span> seconds</strong> long. <span id="stnc_2007">Between 2007 and 2024, <strong><span class="agency-name"></span></strong> saw a change of <span id="diff2007"></span> seconds in song duration; average song length in 2007 was <strong><span id="mnts_2007"></span> minutes and <span id="scds_2007"></span> seconds</strong>. </span>In 2014, songs were on average about <strong><span id="mnts_2014"></span> minutes and <span id="scds_2014"></span> seconds</strong>, so a difference of about <span id="diff2014"></span> seconds compared to 2024.</p>
                            <p>At 2 minutes and 52 seconds, <strong>HYBE</strong> has the shortest average song duration in 2024 amongst the Big Four companies; <strong>SM Entertainment</strong> has the longest, at 3 minutes and 10 seconds. </p>

                    <p>Songs getting shorter and shorter with time isn‚Äôt rare in mainstream music. Analyses like these have been done in a plethora of genres; my own inspiration for this piece came from <a href="https://www.rapminerz.io/articles/jusquou-les-morceaux-vont-ils-retrecir" target="_blank">RapMinerz‚Äôs analysis of French rap</a>, which found the same trend in song duration, but also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quFdTImUloc&ab_channel=RapMinerz%F0%9F%94%A5%E2%9B%8F%EF%B8%8F" target="_blank">significant change in song structure</a>. <em>The Washington Post</em> also did <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/interactive/2024/shorter-songs-again/" target="_blank">a similar analysis across mainstream music</a>, which did include a mention of New Jeans. Commentary on the same phenomenon also floods the Internet, such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMUbuQWzI-c&ab_channel=everglow-up" target="_blank">this (really interesting) video</a> on this very same trend in K-Pop.</p>
                    <p>Technological changes in the industry are often pointed to as the main culprit, especially the rise of streaming platforms like Spotify and Apple Music in the early 2010s. A two-minute song on a streaming platform will be played more often in the span of an hour than a four-minute one‚Äîand thus, will likely generate more revenue at the end of the line. Since plays are counted only starting at the 30-second mark, artists tend not to waste time on an elaborate intro anymore‚Äîit is more profitable, after all, to get to the hook as quickly as one can before you skip the song, which can also lead to a shorter song overall.</p>
                    <p>Something that came out in both <em>The Washington Post</em>‚Äôs and RapMinerz‚Äôs analyses was the absence of the bridge‚Äîor, in French rap, ‚Äú<em>la mort du troisi√®me couplet</em>‚Äù, or the death of the third verse, a once fundamental part of the structure of a classic hip-hop track. Like many others, I‚Äôve noticed the same trend in K-Pop; while the bridge has long been a treasured and iconic part in song structure in the industry, often allowing for vocal prowess from main singers to elaborate dance breaks, it is less and less rare to see them completely gone from title tracks. </p>

                             <p>Most of the song before the bridge follows a rather simple formula, constructed around two <span style="color: #66c2a5; font-weight: 600;">verses</span>, but it is already more complex than the previous two tracks: <em>Tempo</em> starts with a distinct <span style="color: #a6d854; font-weight: 600;">intro</span>, and also features both a <span style="color: #fc8d62; font-weight: 600;">pre-chorus</span> before and a <span style="color: #ffd92f; font-weight: 600;">post-chorus</span> after each <span style="color: #8da0cb; font-weight: 600;">chorus</span> apart from the last.</p>

                             <p>The wonderful thing about <em>Tempo</em>, though, is the sheer length of its <span style="color: #e78ac3; font-weight: 600;">bridge</span>: at about 70 seconds, it is the longest part of the song and its most complex‚Äîfilled with acapella and tasteful harmonies, creating a whole new moment in the song, while also calling back to the <span style="color: #a6d854; font-weight: 600;">intro</span>. Something that could not have been achieved had the song been a mere 2 minutes and 30-something seconds.</p>

                    <p>It is too soon to call for the ‚Äúdeath of the bridge‚Äù I believe, like it might‚Äôve happened in hip-hop with the disappearance of the third verse. But as we see the rise of this trend, alongside short-content platforms, like TikTok, which bet on virality and dance challenges for success over song quality or length, I also don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a negligible observation. </p>
                    <p>TikTok definitely also adds another layer to this whole phenomenon: our attention spans are now shorter than ever, and it might not be with an elaborate five-minute track that an artist will be able to achieve success on a platform filled with six-second long videos. The strong rise in songs that don‚Äôt even last three minutes in the 2020s is a direct consequence of that.</p>
                    <p>But just like RapMinerz take the time to highlight, shorter songs do not necessarily rhyme with bad songs. I did get into this whole analysis simply because a song I really liked also happened to be a short one. While creativity might not count among the top priorities of entertainment companies and conglomerates, I also find it difficult to believe that the entirety of music can continue to be pumped out in two-minute long tracks, nor that all of those are completely devoid of value and originality.</p>
                    <p>Art finds ways to reinvent itself, to push boundaries, to fight back against restrictions and constraints. And while one might argue that K-Pop is only a byproduct of capitalist conglomerates investing in entertainment, it cannot be completely detached from the art form‚Äîand everything it implies‚Äîthat it is part of. Who‚Äôs to say that no one will explore and experiment with structure and length in the months or years to come? </p>
                    <p>Guess we‚Äôll have to stick around to find out.</p>

                            <p id="metho1">Using MusicBrainz‚Äô API, I was able to build a (rather conservative) dataset of over 9600 K-Pop songs, released between 2004 and 2024. However, the only group whose discography spans beyond those twenty years is TVXQ; in order to keep the analysis as representative as possible of the industry, the cutoff for it was set to 2007. By then, SM Entertainment had already debuted Super Junior and Girls‚Äô Generation, YG Entertainment had launched BIGBANG into the world, and Wonder Girls had also made their debut under JYP, to name a few. </p>
                            <p>In order not to overwhelm my laptop (rip) or MusicBrainz‚Äô database, I set out to keep my API calls as concise as possible, and limited my artist pool to just under a 100. Only groups were considered in this analysis; no soloists were included. This dataset includes all active groups of the ‚ÄúBig Four‚Äù (SM, JYP, YG, and HYBE), as well as active groups and a few inactive ones ranging from midsize companies (i.e. CUBE, FNC, Starship‚Ä¶) to smaller agencies with powerhouse groups (i.e. KQ‚Äôs ATEEZ). Data fetched for each song included the artist name, the album name, the track‚Äôs title, its release date, and its duration in seconds. Only digital releases were considered in the analysis; and even among those, some might still be missing from the dataset for a variety of reasons (absence from MusicBrainz‚Äô own database, issue with API request or output treatment, etc). </p>
                            <p>I am aware this analysis is far from an exhaustive one‚Äînor does it pretend to be. I simply was curious to test out my observations as a day-to-day fan using tangible data, looking into the musical landscape of K-Pop as I have experienced it since my introduction to the genre in 2015. I know many groups and albums are missing from this analysis, and I apologize in advance for it. Please be nice :) </p>
